    text="{=!}The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a confederate government formed from thousands of star systems of the Inner Rim, Mid Rim and Outer Rim Territories which had declared a state of independence from the Galactic Republic, whom the Confederacy had opposed from 24 BBY until 19 BBY following their uprising. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as the government's Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy.">
